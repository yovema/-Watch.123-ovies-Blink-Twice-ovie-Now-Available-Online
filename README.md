Blink Twice has entered the MCU after an agonizing wait, with opportunities to watch and stream the anticipated movie finally becoming available. The MCU's only cinematic release of 2024 has received an immense level of hype as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman finally come together for their iconic team-up as the titular heroes. They are joined by a whose-who of Marvel movie characters whose careers span decades, including several returning X-Men characters such as Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, Aaron Stanford's Pyro, and Jason Flemyng's Azazel.

Blink Twice is Shawn Levy's first shot at directing a Blink Twice movie, although he has worked with Ryan Reynolds in the past in Free Guy and The Adam Project. His comedy credentials make him a good fit for the famously irreverent Blink Twice franchise, which continues the iconic brand of R-rated humor established in Blink Twice and Blink Twice 2, though this time takes things into the MCU timeline. Marvel has been keeping its cards close to its chest when it comes to Blink Twice details, which is a sentiment that extends to its expected release schedule.

Blink Twice Streaming Release Date?

Blink Twice will eventually be released on Disney+, rather than Netflix or Max, as the movie is produced and distributed by Disney. Disney has yet to announce a streaming release date for Blink Twice. The three latest MCU movies to hit streaming — The Marvels, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — all came to Disney+ 89 days after their theatrical debuts. Should the distributor follow suit here, Blink Twice would come to Disney+ on October 23.

Is 'Blink Twice' in Theaters?

Yes, Blink Twice will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel Blink Twice did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after Blink Twice, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller Blink Twice, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Harold and the Purple Crayon.

Watch the Trailer for 'Blink Twice'?

The release of Blink Twice may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Blink Twice and Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Blink Twice (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

When Will Blink Twice Release On Streaming?

When Will Blink Twice Release On Digital , DVD & BLU-Ray?

Before Blink Twice is available to stream with a subscription to Disney Plus, it will be available to buy/rent and download digitally via VOD services likely at a price between $15 - $20. Again, Marvel Studios has yet to confirm a date when Blink Twice will release digitally on home media, though it will probably be around Fall 2024, and September at the earliest.
